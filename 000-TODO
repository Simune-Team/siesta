Things to watch out for before the release 
(Please edit this file as you go along fixing and discovering things)

--- POLITICAL

* JM Cela now appears in the front page of the manual -- Any more credit??

* Approval of choice of symbolic names for the public branches:  

    - DEVELOPMENT : Always the tip of the trunk -- changes frequently
    - BETA        : Now the tip of siesta-3.0 -- mainly fixes and doc updates
    - STABLE      : Currently the tip of siesta-2.0 -- only important fixes.

    These symbols will point to the appropriate branches in the archives
    (it is done with symbolic links).

* Siesta-2.0.3 should be released at the same time as 3.0-beta.

* Names of released packages:

  The beta version should go out as siesta-3.0-b
  Further updates while still in beta will have an extra number: siesta-3.0-b-1
  
  When turned into STABLE, siesta-3.0   (with further 3.0.1, 3.0.2, etc)

  The "DEVELOPMENT" releases might be called siesta-3.5-d-314, where 314 is
  the bzr revision number of the trunk.

--- Code checks 

* The file "periodic_table.f" seems to have some non-standard
  info. For example, for Ce ([Xe]4f1 5d1 6s2 in WebElements, no 4f1
  5d1 in the table.  The table should be checked.

* The Chemical potential fix for O(N) by Pablo is still not done in parallel.
  In general, what to do about the O(N) part? A bigger disclaimer?

--- Building test

* For as many compilers as possible, we should check that there are no
  obvious gotchas in the building, including utilities.

--- Cosmetic and updates of info:

* "2006" date should be changed in many places. This will be done with a
script at the last moment.

* Src/README needs to be updated

* Util/README needs to be updated.

* Util/Plrho/README.pgplot:  The web address given,
  http://dulcinea.uc3m.es/new/Pgplot/ does not seem to be functional

--- Support material

* We have to regenerate all the .out and .xml files in Reference, with
  the proper version string.


--- Documentation

* At least two people need to go over siesta.tex and the
  Docs/ExtraDocs to check for consistency. (In the case of the
  ExtraDocs, to make sure that they are at least useful).

* Siesta.tex is in dire need of a conceptual re-working. We have to
  think about what to do. Emilio suggests turning it into a proper
  Reference Manual, with the introductory material moved to another
  document, possibly merging it with some of the material now in
  Docs/ExtraDocs.  He is going to try.

--- OTHERS

* Pablo suggests including his patches for dynamic slab dipole
  correction and charged slabs. They are not fully tested yet.
