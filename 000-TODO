****************

Things to watch out for befor the release 
(Please edit this file as you go along fixing and discovering things)

--- POLITICAL

* We have to give proper credit to Cela and the BSC in a prominent place (manual, README, ???)

--- Code checks 

* The file "periodic_table.f" seems to have some non-standard
  info. For example, for Ce ([Xe]4f1 5d1 6s2 in WebElements, no 4f1
  5d1 in the table.  The table should be checked.

* The Chemical potential fix for O(N) by Pablo is still not done in parallel.
  In general, what to do about the O(N) part? A bigger disclaimer?

--- Cosmetic and updates of info:

* We are still missing the TranSiesta Manual

* "2006" date should be changed in many places. This will be done with a
script at the last moment (in case the year changes :-) ... just
joking)

* README_TRANSIESTA should disappear from there as its contents
have been added to siesta.tex

* Src/README needs to be updated

* Util/Plrho/README.pgplot 
The web address given http://dulcinea.uc3m.es/new/Pgplot/ does not seem to be functional 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Support material

* We have to regenerate all the .out and .xml files in Reference, with the proper version string.


--- Documentation

* At least two people need to go over siesta.tex and the
  Docs/ExtraDocs to check for consistency. (In the case of the
  ExtraDocs, to make sure that they are at least useful).

* Siesta.tex is in dire need of a conceptual re-working. We have to
  think about what to do.

--- OTHERS
