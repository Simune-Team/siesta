Example of spin-orbit calculation reading a full set of lj projectors
from a PSML file. (Generated by Hamann's oncvpsp program)

To plot the bands:

gnubands -G -F -b 21 -B 30 ge-soc-bands-psml.bands 2>| bands.gplot 1>| bands.dat

  (start at 21 to remove the 20 low-lying spin bands (semicore states))
  (go up to 30 to get two "conduction bands")
  
and then:

 gnuplot -persist bands.gplot
