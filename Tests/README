Automated tests for Siesta.

Go into any test subdirectory and type 'make' (after having compiled the
Siesta program in ../Src).

Reference output files can be found in directory Reference.

See the Makefile for more options.

Some of the most interesting are:

1) Use a given siesta executable:

make SIESTA=/full/path/to/siesta

2) Name of the directory where siesta is run. 
This directory is created as a subdirectory in each test.
You can have several and compare the results using the xml
parser (see README.xml).

make label="something" 

Of course you can use both:

make SIESTA=/var/foo label="something" 

Comparisons can also be done to external Tests hierarchies.
