Testing
-------

a) Automatic: All the tests are run and the xml output is compared
against the xml files stored in the Reference dir. In siesta/Tests
type:

make xmlcheck

b) By hand: in a subdirectory of Tests (which has a completed test
already):

     make xmlcheck

c) Explicit file specification:

    Siesta/Src/xmlparser/test-xml  file1.xml file2.xml


Options
-------

Use the standard way of passing options to make

a) Specify siesta binary (default: the one in the Src)

	make SIESTA=/full/path/to/Siesta


b) specify the name of the directory were siesta will be run.
   This is useful when you are comparing different compilers, flags, etc.

   make label="foo"

They can be combined:
make SIESTA=/var/foo label="something" xmlcheck

Compiling the tester:
--------------------
It is compiled at the same time that SIESTA is compiled.
The sources are in Siesta/Src/xmlparser

Tolerances:
----------
The default tolerance is 1E-4. This value is hardwired at the beginning of:
	Siesta/Tests/test-xml-src/m_compare_tol.f90 

The tolerances can be controlled editing (by hand) the file:
	Siesta/Tests/tolerances.dat

The structure of this file is: label tolerance 

The label reported by the program can be the name of an xml element,
that of its parent, or the name of one of its attributes (for example,
the attribute "value" in CML).
