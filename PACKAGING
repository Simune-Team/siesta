SIESTA PACKAGING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Tagging and branching.
   
   After everything is commited to everybody's  satisfaction (...), 
   we need to tag the release and create a new branch 
   (to hold bug fixes, etc for the 1.3 release lifetime).

   First, we mark the point at the trunk:

   cvs rtag siesta-1-3 siesta

   Then we make a branch tag at that point:

   cvs rtag -b -r siesta-1-3 rel-1-3-branch siesta


2. Go to a clean place and *export* a copy:

   cvs export -r siesta-1-3 -d siesta-1.3 siesta

3. Put the copyright headers and build the serial and parallel
   versions (check that the wording in file copyright is OK...)

   cd siesta-1.3
   sh put_copyright.sh
   sh build_parallel.sh
   sh build_serial.sh

   (Remember to put the compiled postscript in Docs, as advertised
    in top level README)


4. Tar and gzip the packages:

    tar cf - siesta-1.3s | gzip > siesta-1.3s.tgz
    tar cf - siesta-1.3p | gzip > siesta-1.3p.tgz
