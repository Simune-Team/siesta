To compile this version of Siesta you need the following libraries:

xmlf90
libPSML
libGridXC (optionally with libxc)

which are also part of the ESL bundle
(https://gitlab.com/ElectronicStructureLibrary/esl-bundle).
Note that you need version 0.4 of the ESL bundle.

Alternatively, the tarballs for the libraries can be downloaded from Launchpad:

https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/trunk/1.5/+download/xmlf90-1.5.4.tar.gz
https://launchpad.net/libpsml/trunk/1.1/+download/libpsml-1.1.7.tgz
https://launchpad.net/libgridxc/trunk/0.8/+download/libgridxc-0.8.5.tgz

(and soon from https://gitlab.com/siesta-project)

NOTE: You need version 1.5.4 of the xmlf90 library,
      at least version 0.8.5 of the libgridxc library, and
      at least version 1.1.7 of the libpsml library.

** Steps in detail

* With the ESL bundle:

-  Build and install the bundle following the instructions provided.

-  Use as starting point for your arch.make the file
   Obj/gfortran-esl-bundle.make.

* If manually compiling the required libraries:

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc libraries (follow the
  instructions in the appropriate packages).

- Go back to the Siesta building directory, review the settings of the
  xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc import lines in the arch.make file, and type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    make

NOTE: The structure of the arch.make file has changed a bit. MPI and NETCDF
      functionality is now requested by setting WITH_MPI and WITH_NETCDF,
      respectively, and there must be specific FC_SERIAL and FC_PARALLEL
      symbols for the Fortran compiler. See the examples in Obj/*.make.
