To compile this version of Siesta you need the xmlf90 and libPSML libraries, which can
be downloaded from Launchpad:

http://launchpad.net/libpsml
http://launchpad.net/xmlf90

Direct links to current tarballs:

wget https://launchpad.net/libpsml/trunk/0.9-build/+download/libpsml-0.9.3.tgz
wget https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/trunk/1.4/+download/xmlf90-1.4.1.tgz

** Steps in detail

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90 and libpsml libraries (follow the instructions in the appropriate
  packages).

  * For xmlf90, create a building directory and copy there the appropriate fortran.mk
    (you can re-use the essential subset of your Siesta arch.make)

    Then, type

        make

    (Optionally, make PREFIX=/path/to/installation install)
	
  * For libpsml, the  fortran.mk previously prepared for xmlf90 can be reused.

    Simply make sure that the src/fortran.mk file contains the right path
    for the location of the compiled xmlf90 library.

- Go back to the Siesta building directory, review the settings of the
  xmlf90 and libpsml import lines in the arch.make file, and type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    make
