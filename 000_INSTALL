To compile this version of Siesta you need the following libraries:

xmlf90
libPSML
libGridXC (optionally with libxc)

These can be downloaded from Launchpad:

https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/trunk/1.5/+download/xmlf90-1.5.3.tar.gz
https://launchpad.net/libpsml/trunk/1.1/+download/libpsml-1.1.6.tgz
https://launchpad.net/libgridxc/trunk/0.8/+download/libgridxc-0.8.0.tgz


NOTE: You need at least version 1.5.3 of the xmlf90 library,
      at least version 0.8.0 of the libgridxc library, and
      at least version 1.1.6 of the libpsml library.

** Steps in detail

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc libraries (follow the
  instructions in the appropriate packages).

- Go back to the Siesta building directory, review the settings of the
  xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc import lines in the arch.make file, and type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    make

NOTE: The structure of the arch.make file has changed a bit. MPI and NETCDF
      functionality is now requested by setting WITH_MPI and WITH_NETCDF,
      respectively, and there must be specific FC_SERIAL and FC_PARALLEL
      symbols for the Fortran compiler.
