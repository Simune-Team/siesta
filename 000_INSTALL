To compile this version of Siesta you need the following libraries:

xmlf90
libPSML
libGridXC

These can be downloaded from Launchpad. The direct links to current tarballs are

wget https://launchpad.net/libpsml/trunk/0.9-build/+download/libpsml-0.9.4.tgz
wget https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/trunk/1.5/+download/xmlf90-1.5.0.tgz
wget https://launchpad.net/libgridxc/trunk/0.6/+download/libgridxc-0.6.1.tgz

NOTE: You need at least version 1.5.0 of the xmlf90 library,
      and at least version 0.6.1 of the libgridxc library.

** Steps in detail

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc libraries (follow the
  instructions in the appropriate packages).

  * For xmlf90, create a building directory and copy there the appropriate fortran.mk
    (you can re-use the essential subset of your Siesta arch.make)

    Then, type

        make

    (Optionally, make PREFIX=/path/to/installation install)
	
  * For libpsml, the  fortran.mk previously prepared for xmlf90 can be reused.

    Simply make sure that the src/fortran.mk file contains the right path
    for the location of the compiled xmlf90 library.

  * For libgridxc, the  fortran.mk previously prepared for xmlf90 can be reused.

    Optionally, support for libxc can be compiled in, but it is still early days
    and the documentation is sparse.
    

- Go back to the Siesta building directory, review the settings of the
  xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc import lines in the arch.make file, and type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    make
