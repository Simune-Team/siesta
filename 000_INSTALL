To compile this version of Siesta you need the following libraries:

xmlf90
libPSML
libGridXC

These can be downloaded from Launchpad. The direct links to current
tarballs are

wget https://launchpad.net/libpsml/trunk/1.0-freeze/+download/libpsml-1.0.5.tgz
wget https://launchpad.net/xmlf90/trunk/1.5/+download/xmlf90-1.5.0.tgz
wget https://launchpad.net/libgridxc/trunk/0.7/+download/libgridxc-0.7.0.tgz

NOTE: You need at least version 1.5.0 of the xmlf90 library,
      at least version 0.7.1 of the libgridxc library, and
      at least version 1.0.5 of the libpsml library.

** Steps in detail

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc libraries (follow the
  instructions in the appropriate packages).

- Go back to the Siesta building directory, review the settings of the
  xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc import lines in the arch.make file, and type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    make
