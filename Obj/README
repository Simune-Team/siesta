This directory is the default place to hold the object files resulting
from the compilation of the sources in Src. 
The VPATH mechanism of modern 'make' programs is used. This scheme has
many advantages. Among them:

- The Src directory is kept pristine.
- Many different object directories can be used concurrently to
  compile the program with different compilers or optimization levels.
  (see below the NOTE for Advanced Users)

If you just want to compile the program, issue the command:

  sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh

to populate this directory with the minimal scaffolding of makefiles, and
then make sure that you create an 'arch.make' file. Then, type

  make

To compile utility programs (those living in Util), you can just simply
use the provided makefiles, typing "make" as appropriate.

* arch.make files
  This directory contains several example arch.make files. The differences
  in logic have mostly to do with the treatment of libgridxc.

    gridxc-0.8.5-no-autotools.make: configurable at the top for serial
                                    and parallel operation. It
                                    requires an installation of
                                    libgridxc with a top-level
                                    gridxc.mk file dispatching the
                                    appropriate parallel or serial
                                    symbols (this is available in
                                    libgridxc-0.8 to 0.8.5).

    gfortran-esl-bundle.make: For use with the ESL bundle (version
                              0.4).  Change as appropriate if a
                              different compiler was used to build the
                              bundle.
			       
    gridxc-0.8.5.1-autotools.make: Intended for the gridxc-0.8.5.1
                                   version integrated in the bundle, which
				   is 0.8.5 with an auto-tools building system.
				   

    gfortran-multiconfig.make: (for libgridxc >= 0.9.3, installed with
                               '--enable-multi-config') configurable
                               at the top for serial and parallel
                               operation, and also supporting the use
                               of single-precision grid arrays.


			  
    Of lesser interest are:
    
    gfortran.make for old-style serial compilation of siesta using gfortran

    intel.make for old-style serial compilation of siesta using the ifort Intel compiler.

    This is still in flux.
    
* NOTE for Advanced Users

The mechanism described here can be repeated in other directories at the same level,
with different names. Simply provide the appropriate arch.make, and issue the
setup command above. To compile utility programs, you need to use the form:

   make OBJDIR=ObjName

where ObjName is the name of the object directory of your choice.
