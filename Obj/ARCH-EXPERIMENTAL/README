Experimental mechanism for building.

The file 'master-raw.make' contains the logic for building Siesta,
valid for (most) versions, and with the ability to select the desired
capabilities. It is structured in three sections:

-------------------
A) Features needed.

They are selected by setting the 'WITH_XXX' variables to 1.

B) Symbols related to location of libraries.

They can refer to the location of a specific package (e.g. PSML_ROOT),
or to the actual libraries (e.g. SCALAPACK_LIBS). In some cases (such
as netCDF) several package-location symbols might be needed, and it might be necessary to
override directly the NETCDF_LIBS and NETCDF_INCFLAGS in hard cases.

C) Compiler names and options

-------------------

These sections can be completed in-situ in the file, or read from a
'fortran.mk' file. Examples of the latter can be found in the .mk
files in this directory. It is not yet decided which is best, or
whether an intermediate approach (e.g. defining the capabilities in
the master file and the compiler and library symbols in the .mk file)
might be more appopriate.

The master file logic works for versions of Siesta >= 4.1

There are many possibilities. Suggestions and comments are welcome.
