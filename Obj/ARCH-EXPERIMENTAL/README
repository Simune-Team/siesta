Experimental mechanism for building.

The file 'master-raw.make' contains the logic for building Siesta,
valid for (most) versions, and with the ability to select the desired
capabilities. It is structured in four sections:

-------------------
A) Features needed.

They are selected by setting the 'WITH_XXX' variables to 1.

B) Symbols related to location of libraries.

They can refer to the location of a specific package (e.g. PSML_ROOT),
or to the actual libraries (e.g. SCALAPACK_LIBS). In some cases (such
as netCDF) several package-location symbols might be needed, and it might be necessary to
override directly the NETCDF_LIBS and NETCDF_INCFLAGS in hard cases.

C) Compiler names and options

D) Specific needs for certain files (for example, compilation without optimization)

-------------------

These sections can be completed in-situ in the file, or read from a
'fortran.mk' file. Examples of the latter can be found in the .mk
files in this directory. It is not yet decided which is best, or
whether an intermediate approach (e.g. defining the capabilities in
the master file and the compiler and library symbols in the .mk file)
might be more appopriate.

Regarding block D): if the modified dependency lines are now at the
top of the arch.make file, they might cause an unwanted setting of the
"default" target in some makefiles. For example, in Util/TS/tshs2tshs,
the 'default' target line was placed *after* including the arch.make
file. The 'atom.o' dependency line in the mn-intel.mk helper file
forced the creation of 'atom.o', which was wrong.
To fix this, the 'default' target line has to come near the top of the makefile.


The master file logic works for versions of Siesta >= 4.1

There are many possibilities. Suggestions and comments are welcome.
