A series of simple examples with the
water molecule.

h2o: Just a simple run with the option
     of plotting the charge density.

h2o_cell: Playing with the intermolecule
          separation. For large separations
          the results should converge to
          the "real" molecule ones. 
          
h2o_relax: An important example of the
           coordinate relaxation capabilities
           of Siesta.
