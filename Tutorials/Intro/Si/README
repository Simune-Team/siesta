Silicon, the archetypal semiconductor.

Si:  Focus on the covalent bonding.
     Look at the charge density.

Si (more): You can carry out 
           total-energy calculations
           for different lattice constants
           to predict the equilibrium 
           volume and the bulk modulus.

Si_strele: Electronic Structure.
           You will get the bands and
           the Density of States.
           Use 
              sh bands.sh

	   and
        	gnuplot dos.gplot
