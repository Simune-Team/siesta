Release notes for PSML-enabled version of SIESTA, Mark R1 

*** Use of PSML pseudopotentials

 * Please see the file README_PSML in the top directory for important
   information.

*** Backward-compatibility issues

 * The transiesta executable has been deprecated. Please use
      siesta --electrode 
   for electrode calculations. For regular transiesta runs, there
   is no need for the specific executable. 

*** New features

 - Enabled custom k-points in PDOS and SCF calculations.

 - Added the CheSS solver as a new solution method. This is
   a linear scaling solver which calculates the density matrix and the
   energy density matrix.

 - Added the Cold-smearing method for zero-temperature limit
   with smearing.

 - TDDFT implemented by R. Ullah via older code from
   D. Sanchez-Portal.
