This file is: siesta/Examples/Vps/README

The siesta/Examples/Vps directory contains the pseudopotentials required 
by the SIESTA run examples contained in siesta/Examples, as well as the 
input files used to generate those pseudopotentials with the 
siesta/Pseudo/atom/atm program.

These pseudopotentials are provided only as examples, and we do not 
guarantee their accuracy or transferability. We warn you that
pseudopotential generation may be tricky,  and that all pseudopotentials
should be thoroughly checked by the user before relying on them.
