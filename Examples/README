Here you can find example fdf files, pseudopotential files and 
pseudopotential-generation input files (see Tutorial in Pseudo/atom). 
(You don't need to generate your pseudos to run these examples, 
but it is very advisable to know how to generate and test 
pseudopotentials, as explained within the Pseudo/atom directory).

Other, ready-to-run examples, can be fund in directory Tests in the main distribution.
