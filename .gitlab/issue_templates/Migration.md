Migration of @user Launchpad SIESTA branches to Git and Gitlab

Please use the sentence above as title for your issue and make sure you replace `@user` above by your Gitlab login.

Please replace the following example list by the Launchpad URLs of your SIESTA branches, one URL per line:

- lp:~user/siesta/branch1
- lp:~user/siesta/branch2
- lp:~user/siesta/branch3

If you don't know where to find your SIESTA branches, you can have a look at the following page:

  https://code.launchpad.net/siesta

Please note that migrating all your branches is not mandatory. Feel free to forget about branches that have already been merged into the trunk of SIESTA.
