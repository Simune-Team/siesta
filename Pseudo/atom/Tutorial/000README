This directory contains examples of all-electron and
pseudopotential-generation atomic calculations.

** WARNING: You should thoroughly test a pseudopotential before using it.
            The input files in this tree are not meant to represent
            good pseudopotentials.

Input files have a .inp extension, and should be run using the ae.sh
(all-electron), pg.sh (ps generation), or pt.sh (ps test) shell
scripts. See the manual (Docs/atom.tex) for details.

After the run, the output information and plotting scripts will reside
in a sub-directory whose name is that of the input file without the
.inp extension.
