* This version of ATOM depends significantly on some Siesta
routines. If you got this ATOM package as a stand-alone unit,
please request an older version. This situation will not
be resolved until the XC package, including the
van-der-Waals support,  is made self-contained.

* Compilation is now done using the top-level arch.make
* You get everything, including XML support.
