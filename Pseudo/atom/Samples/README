This directory contains examples of all-electron and
pseudopotential-generation atomic calculations.

** WARNING: You should thoroughly test a pseudopotential before using it.
	    The input files in this directory are not meant to represent
	    good pseudopotentials.

Input files have a .inp extension, and should be run using the ae.sh
(all-electron), pg.sh (ps generation), or pt.sh (ps test) shell
scripts. 

These scripts assume that the executable (atm) resides in the
directory above this one. If you want to use the scripts in some
other place you will have to modify the definition of "prog" in them.

After the run, the output information will reside in a sub-directory
whose name is that of the input file without the .inp
extension. Several files are produced:

OUT	Human readable output file with information about energy levels,
	total energies, pseudopotential information, etc.

	(For c.tm2, there is a sample output file for test purposes)

CHARGE	ASCII file containing the all-electron charge density for 
	plotting purposes.
	
	Column format:   r (au)  rho_up rho_down   rho_core
	 (so the total valence charge is rho_up+rho_down - rho_core)

	The charge densities are actually 4 * pi * r^2 * rho.

PSCHARGE The same as charge, except for the (pseudo) valence charge.

VPSOUT	Pseudopotential binary file. A copy with the extension .vps is
	made by pg.sh. This file is needed for a pseudopotential test run.


Around a dozen files with plotting information are also produced.
Wavefunction, pseudopotential, and logarithmic derivative plots can be
generated using the SuperMongo package. Scripts for other graphics
programs will be made available as the need arises.
