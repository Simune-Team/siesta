This directory contains examples of all-electron and
pseudopotential-generation atomic calculations.

** WARNING: You should thoroughly test a pseudopotential before using it.
	    The input files in this directory are not meant to represent
	    good pseudopotentials.

Input files have a .inp extension, and should be run using the ae.sh
(all-electron), pg.sh (ps generation), or pt.sh (ps test) shell
scripts. 

These scripts assume that the executable (atm) resides in the
directory above this one. If you want to use the scripts in some
other place you will have to modify the definition of "prog" in them.

After the run, the output information will reside in a sub-directory
whose name is that of the input file without the .inp
extension. Several files are produced (see User.Guide in the Docs directory).
