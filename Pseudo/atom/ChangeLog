	* (Maider Machado) Added support for Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr exchange
	and correlation flavor. It is requested by the string "bl" in the
	input file.

	* Put the Berkeley RCS sources under CVS control, and tagged them
	as RCSfiles.

	* Added some extra files to synch the module to ATM_1_0. Tagged as
	ATOM_1_0. Still no BHS, Contrib, Docs, or Utils subdirectories.
	The presence of Id and Log keyword flags made it appear as if
	there have been changes in every file...
	
	* Made some cosmetic changes (mainly use of 'unknown' as opening
	status for files and explicit setting of function values before
	exceptional returns). Added BHS, Contrib, and Docs. 
	Tagged as ATOM_1_1.

	* Implemented an interface to the Balbas-Soler XC package, and
	changed the default grid generation procedure. The old Berkeley
	behavior can be recovered by specifying the 'ucb' compatibility
	mode (implemented through the 'compat' files). Added an improved
	Util (including a ghostwatcher program from the UAM) and a Samples
	directory with execution and plotting scripts. Tagged as ATOM_1_2
	
************************
	The following changes were done at Berkeley starting from
	the Troullier-Martins code (actually, from a heavily modified
	version of it with declared variables, include files, and better
	structure).

	* Modified the decision tree in atm.f dealing with
	charge and potential initialization for multiple runs.
	(Tip from somebody in Stuttgart via Christian Elsasser).

	* Modified dsolv2. The core charge was always computed
	non-relativistically!.

Mon May 18 10:57:02 1992  Alberto Garcia  (alberto at savanna)

	* Modified dsolv2 to compute the core charge density in
	all cases (not only for core corr ps generation). Wrote	
	subroutine denplot to process the core and valence charge
	resulting from an all-electron calculation.

Wed Apr 22 20:23:33 1992  Alberto Garcia  (alberto at savanna)

	* Tentatively removed the code snippet in wrapup that
	  turns off relativity.

	* The logarithmic derivative of the pseudo-wave function is
	now computed in routine wrapup. A separate pseudopotential
	test is not required. (This is experimental).
	Logder now accepts character*2 flag (current values: 'AE', 'PS')
	to write the information to the appropriate file.
	
	Relativistic calculations are tricky: The pseudopotential is
	treated in a non-relativistic manner in wrapup, and that results
	in eigenvalue mismatches that in turn produce errors in the
	logarithmic derivative comparison.
