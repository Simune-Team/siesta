Don Hamann's ONCVPSP program (http://www.mat-simresearch.com/)
can be patched to generate PSML files.

The PSML files will contain the semilocal versions of the
pseudopotentials, in addition to the local potential and
fully-nonlocal projectors.

Instead of re-distributing a patched version, we make available a
patch file in this directory, of the form (for V. 3.2.3)

    oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-patch-XX

where XX stands for the patch level number.

To obtain a patched version, proceed as follows:

1. Download oncvpsp-3.2.3 from the above address.
2. Unpack:

   tar xzf oncvpsp-3.2.3.tar.gz

3. Copy the source tree:

   cp -rp oncvpsp-3.2.3 oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-patch-XX

4. Apply patch (note carefully the location before
   issuing the command):

   cd oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-patch-XX
   patch -p1 < ../oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-patch-XX


Follow the instructions in INSTALL to build the executables
and configure the scripts.


NOTE: For reference, the patch file was generated by a command similar
to the following:

 diff -Naur oncvpsp-3.2.3 oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-XX >| oncvpsp-3.2.3--psml-XX.patch

where the first directory is the pristine source tree downloaded from
MatSimResearch, and the second one an exported tree from our
development archives.
