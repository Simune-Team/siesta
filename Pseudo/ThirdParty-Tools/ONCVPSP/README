Don Hamann's ONCVPSP program (http://www.mat-simresearch.com/)
can be patched to generate PSML files.

The PSML files will contain the semilocal versions of the
pseudopotentials, in addition to the local potential and
fully-nonlocal projectors.

Instead of re-distributing a patched version, we make available a
patch file in this directory, of the form (for V. 3.2.2; there is
also a patch for the newer 3.2.3 version):

    oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-patch-XX

where XX stands for the patch level number.

To obtain a patched version, proceed as follows:

1. Download oncvpsp-3.2.2 from the above address.
2. Unpack:

   tar xzf oncvpsp-3.2.2.tar.gz

3. Copy the source tree:

   cp -rp oncvpsp-3.2.2 oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-patch-XX

4. Apply patch (note carefully the location before
   issuing the command):

   cd oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-patch-XX
   patch -p1 < ../oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-patch-XX


Follow the instructions in INSTALL to build the executables
and configure the scripts.


NOTE: For reference, the patch file was generated by a command similar
to the following:

 rm oncvpsp-3.2.2/src/.sratom.f90.swp
 diff -Naur oncvpsp-3.2.2 oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-XX >| oncvpsp-3.2.2--psml-XX.patch

where the first directory is the pristine source tree downloaded from
MatSimResearch, and the second one an exported tree from our
development archives. The first 'rm' command is necessary to remove a
stray binary file.
