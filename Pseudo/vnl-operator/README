This directory holds a standalone program ('psop') to generate, from a
pseudopotential file holding semilocal-potential information, a full Vnl
operator in the classic Siesta style (special Vlocal, plus KB projectors).
The information is produced in XML, in a form compatible with the PSML format.

The program can read .psf, .vps, and .psml files. It generates a VNL
file with the information. If the source is a .psml file, the script
'add-siesta-vnl.sh' can be used to generate a complete PSML file in
which the VNL section is added, possibly replacing an existing
<pseudopotential-operator> element.

To build the program, type

 make OBJDIR=Obj_directory 

where Obj_directory is the name of the object directory in which you have
built the rest of Siesta. If you are using the default Obj directory you
can just type 'make'.

'psop' accepts command-line options. To see the complete list, type
 
  psop -h

Known limitations:

 -- There is currently no way to tell the program to build several
    projectors for a given l channel. It will build just one, except
    when semicore shells are present. In that case it will add one
    projector per semicore shell.

 -- The reference energies are those used by default by Siesta.
