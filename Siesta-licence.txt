SIESTA LICENCE

Motivation and Preamble
The SIESTA program has been devised for its general use in research 
within the academic community. Some conditions have been defined for 
the use, distribution, and modification of SIESTA, which the authors 
consider fair and within the common fair practices in the academic 
community.
1. Definitions 
"The Authors" are:
    Emilio Artacho, 	University of Cambridge
    Julian Gale, 	Imperial College, London
    Alberto García, 	Universidad del País Vasco, Bilbao
    Javier Junquera, 	Rutgers University
    Pablo Ordejón, 	ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona
    Daniel Sánchez-Portal, Universidad del País Vasco, San Sebastian
    José M. Soler, 	Universidad Autónoma de Madrid
Although we, the Authors, acknowledge that a limited number of auxiliary 
subroutines were written by (or are based on previous subroutines written 
by) other authors consider that the implementation of all the basic 
algorithms of the SIESTA program is ours.
The SIESTA team ("the Developers") are the Authors and:
   Richard M. Martin   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
"The Copyright-Holder" is:
   The Fundación General de la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid 
(FGUAM).
The valid distributors of the SIESTA package ("The Distributors") are the 
Developers, and Copyright-Holder as specified above.
"The SIESTA package" is the suite of software, including the SIESTA 
code itself, but also all other software, documentation, scripts, and ancillary 
support material distributed as a single entity. This Licence covers the 
entirety of said data.
The Licensee is the person (never an institution) to whom the SIESTA 
package is distributed (under the terms of this Licence) by the Distributors; 
they are bound by this agreement.
2. NO WARRANTY
There is no warranty for any part of the SIESTA package. The SIESTA 
package is provided by the Distributors "as-is" without warranty of any 
kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied 
warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no event 
shall the Distributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, 
exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, 
procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or 
business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, 
whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or 
otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if 
advised of the possibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality 
or performance of the program, or any action the Licensee may take based 
on the output of any part of the SIESTA package, is with the Licensee.
3. Limitation of Usage
The use of the SIESTA package is restricted solely to academic purposes: 
the Authors reserve the exclusive right to determine what purposes are 
academic, and to withhold the right to use the SIESTA package where they 
are not satisfied that this condition is fulfilled.
The Licensee is hereby provided with a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to 
use any part of the SIESTA package, and to display, publish, perform, or 
otherwise use results obtained by use of the SIESTA package in any form, 
subject to the restriction that in any paper or other academic publication 
containing results wholly or partially derived from the results of use of the 
SIESTA package, the following papers must be cited in the normal manner:
1. "Self-consistent order-N density-functional calculations for very large 
systems", P. Ordejón, E. Artacho and J. M. Soler, Phys. Rev. B (Rapid 
Comm.) 53, R10441-10443 (1996).
2. "The SIESTA method for ab initio order-N materials simulation" J. M. 
Soler, E. Artacho, J. D. Gale, A. García, J. Junquera, P. Ordejón, and D. 
Sánchez-Portal, J. Phys.: Condens. Matt. 14, 2745-2779 (2002).
Other papers relevant to the SIESTA package and method should be cited 
as best scientific practice dictates.
Licensees are recommended to send reference to the Developers of any 
publication containing results wholly or partially derived from the results 
of use of the SIESTA package.
The above-mentioned right to use the code is extensive to the members of 
the research group of the Licensee as long as the use is in collaboration 
with the Licensee leading to co-authored publication(s).
4. Support
The present Licence does not imply support services of any kind to the 
Licensee by the Distributors, including, but not limited to, installation, 
compilation and use of the software in the package.
5. Modification
Licensees are permitted to modify SIESTA for their own private use; in 
any paper containing results wholly or partially derived from the use of a 
modified version of SIESTA, the authors are required to state that a 
privately modified version of SIESTA is used, and satisfy the conditions of 
use stated above.
The Developers encourage Licensees to submit their modifications of the 
SIESTA package to them, so that the SIESTA package does not fork, and 
furthermore so that the package can be improved for all users. Licensees 
can thereby benefit from the ulterior developments of SIESTA.
To this end, the Developers wish to encourage Licensees to make any 
modifications to the SIESTA package in as modular a fashion as possible: 
for example, interacting via files, or via well-defined interface calls. This 
permits maintenance of these modifications as a separate entity in many 
cases, and may allow their separation from SIESTA and distribution as a 
separate piece of software: in that case, such software is not subject to this 
Licence, and the authors of the separate software are free to choose any 
licensing terms they desire.
However, if a given modification must be incorporated directly into the 
SIESTA package, the author(s) of any such modifications must provide a 
perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable license to the Authors and Developers, 
and the Copyright-Holder, to further modify their modifications ("the 
Contributed Code") as may prove necessary for the future development of 
SIESTA, and to distribute the Contributed Code (in its original or any later 
modified form) as part of the SIESTA package.
This assignation of rights does not affect the rights of Licensees to receive 
credit for their work, or any other benefits (financial or otherwise) later 
accruing from their modifications, or the copyright of the Licensees in any 
code they have written.
The Developers, in the interests of maintaining the efficiency of the 
SIESTA package and the modularity of its code base, actively encourage 
all those considering modifications to the SIESTA package to discuss their 
planned modifications with the Developers beforehand.
6. Redistribution
The authors reserve the exclusive right to distribute the SIESTA package. 
Licensees have no right to distribute the SIESTA package, a modified or 
alternative version thereof, or any other program making direct use of parts 
of the SIESTA package, without the prior written consent of the 
Distributors.
7. All Other Rights
All other rights not explicitly mentioned in this document are reserved.  In 
particular, the Authors reserve all rights to resolve any and all conflicts 
arising in the development and distribution policies of the SIESTA 
package.
All Licensees, receiving the SIESTA package for any purpose, accept this 
by signing this Licence.
This Licence takes effect when signed and dated by both the prospective 
Licensee and a Distributor of SIESTA (as defined above), and not before.
Without a valid Licence, a prospective Licensee does not have the right to 
use or modify the SIESTA package.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
Licence document, but changing it is not permitted.
