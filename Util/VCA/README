Utilities for VCA calculations

VCA stands for "Virtual Crystal Approximation".

A new program (mixps) has been written to mix pseudopotentials. It
takes as command-line arguments the names (actually labels) of the two
atoms involved (A and B), and the mixing parameter. Then it combines
the information in A.psf and B.psf and creates a new file AB-0.xxxxx.psf,
where 0.xxxxx is the mixing parameter (to five decimal places) specified.
It outputs also a SyntheticAtoms block suitable for use by Siesta, and
a MIXLABEL file which contains the final label used (useful for scripts).

This program is located in the top directory to ease compilation. Just
type "make mixps" to compile.

Programs zerops.f and zerops_rel.f generate "null pseudopotentials", which
can also be found in Tests/Pseudos.


NOTES:

- The basis set is generated by Siesta using the "mixed"
pseudopotential. There is no provision at this time to "mix" basis
sets, or in general to build a basis set using information about the
basis sets for the atoms involved in the mix. On the other hand, basis
sets for synthetic atoms can be optimized as usual.

- PseudoCore charges are mixed if they exist in the individual atoms'
pseudopotential files. This might lead to extra non-linearities in the
solid-state calculation.

- Once Siesta reads the new .psf file for the hybrid, it generates a
local-pseudopotential charge and a local pseudopotential from it. Note
that this means that the local pseudopotential is not a true mix of
the local pseudopotentials of the individual atoms.

- Once Siesta reads the "neutral-atom configuration" from the
SyntheticAtoms block, it generates the appropriate neutral-atom potential
using the local pseudopotential and the atomic charge density.
