Title: Small bug reported by Stephanie Reich and example files
Author: Pablo Ordejon <ordeojn@icmab.es>

Description:
  A bug in the counting of equivalent neighbours for q-point
phonon calculations was detected by S. Reich. The bug produced
small errors in the computed phonon band frecuencies and 
eigenvectors (a few percent at most).
  The output of fcbuild has been changed to include more significant
digits in the coordinates and lattice constant.
  The examples files have been changed slightly. In particular,
I have included the input for Siesta necessary to reproduce
the provided output. Also, the output files have been updated
according to the Siesta input (which is slightly different from
the old one), and for the correction of the bug above. Also,
input pseudopotential files are provided. This way, users should
be able to reproduce the provided results.
