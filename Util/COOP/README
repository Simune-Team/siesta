MPROP processes wave-functions, and the Hamiltonian and overlap-matrix
from Siesta to produce COOP/COHP curves, and (partial) densities of
states.

M. Llunell (U. Barcelona) prepared an early version.
A. Garcia  (ICMAB-CSIC) made significant corrections and improvements to
           make it work seamlessly with Siesta, and optimized it.

To use it, you first need to tell Siesta to produce the required information,
by including the fdf directive

COOP.Write  .true.

in the input file. Copy the resulting .WFSX and .HSX files.

Then, prepare a .mpr file like those you can find in the Tests directory, and
execute mprop (type 'mprop -h' for usage notes).
See the Docs directory for some extra documentation (work in progress).

DM_CREATOR selects the states in a given energy interval to prepare a
"fake" density matrix that can be later used, for example, to plot the
charge density associated to those states.
