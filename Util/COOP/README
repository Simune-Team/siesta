MPROP processes wave-functions, and the Hamiltonian and overlap-matrix
from Siesta to produce COOP/COHP curves, and (partial) densities of
states.

M. Llunell (U. Barcelona) prepared an early prototype.
A. Garcia  (ICMAB-CSIC) made significant corrections and improvements to
           make it work seamlessly with Siesta, and optimized it.

To use it, you first need to tell Siesta to produce the required information,
by including the fdf directive

COOP.Write  .true.

in the input file. Copy the resulting .WFSX and .HSX files.

Then, prepare a .mpr file like those you can find in the Tests directory, and
execute mprop (type 'mprop -h' for usage notes).
See the Docs directory for some extra documentation (work in progress).

FAT computes the projections of eigenvectors (typically from a
band-structure calculation in which output of wave-functions has been
requested with the new option "Write.WFS.For.Bands") onto specified
orbital sets (the specification follows the syntax of PDOS
calculations with MPROP). The resulting "fatbands" can be plotted with
the tools in Util/Bands.

DM_CREATOR selects the states in a given energy interval to prepare a
"fake" density matrix that can be later used, for example, to plot the
charge density associated to those states.

SPIN_TEXTURE computes the "spin texture" of the nk spinor states stored in a WFSX
file. The selection of states is at the moment only on the basis of an energy interval
(the whole range of energies in the file by default).

The WFSX file can be created during a Siesta calculation in several ways

-- Using the 'COOP.Write T' option: a wave-function set using the
   k-point sampling of the BZ used in the scf cycle will be written (see manual).

-- Using the 'BandPoints' or 'BandLines' blocks (see manual), *together* with the options

   	 SaveHS T
	 Wfs.Write.For.Bands T

-- Using the WaveFuncKpoints block, *together* with the option
   	 SaveHS T

The 'SaveHS T' option is needed to generate information about the overlap matrix, which is
needed by the program.
