Get the data from Tests/si_fatbands, i.e., copy the si_fatbands.HSX
and the si_fatbands.bands.WFSX files, and process them:

/path/to/fat [options] fatbands

Then, a number of .EIGFAT files will be produced. These files contain
*both* the eigenvalues and the projection weight for each orbital set
in the .mpr file, and can be re-processed by the "eigfat2plot" program
in Util/Bands to produce a data file suitable for plotting by Gnuplot.

Alternatively, users might want to produce their own post-processors.
