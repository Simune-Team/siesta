Get the data from Tests/si_fatbands, i.e., copy the si_fatbands.HSX
and the si_fatbands.bands.WFSX files, and process them:

/path/to/fat [options] fatbands

Then, a number of .EIGFAT files will be produced. These can be re-processed, 
together with the standard .bands file by the "fatbands" program in
Util/Bands.
