Compile with
$ cd Obj
$ make                      (see siesta manual for siesta compilation)
$ cd ../Util/Unfolding/Src
$ make

Sample serial run (for serial compilation according to Obj/arch.make):
$ cd ../Examples/Si/Bulk/Si8
$ ../../../../../../Obj/siesta < si8.fdf > si8.out
$ ../../../../Src/unfold < si8.fdf > si8.unfold.out

Sample parallel run:
$ cd ../Examples/Si/Bulk/Si8
$ mpirun -np 16 ../../../../../../Obj/siesta < si8.fdf > si8.out
$ mpirun -np 4 ../../../../Src/unfold < si8.fdf > si8.unfold.out

The unfolding/refolding specifications are given by two extra fdf blocks
in the same datafile used by siesta. For example:
------------
LatticeConstant	5.430 Ang  # used by siesta and unfold
BandLinesScale  pi/a       # used in BandLines and UnfoldedBandLines blocks

%block LatticeVectors      # simulation cell used by siesta and unfold
   1.000  0.000  0.000     # this is an 8-atom Si supercell
   0.000  1.000  0.000
   0.000  0.000  1.000
%endblock LatticeVectors

COOP.Write   true          # make siesta write the .HSX file used by unfold

%block UnfoldedBandLines

 100   0.0  0.0  0.0       # numQ_in_line, endLine_qVector
 120   6.0  0.0  0.0       # add as many lines as required
%endblock UnfoldedBandLines

RefoldingGcutoff   25 Ry   # Cutoff for (the square of) refolding G vectors

%block RefoldingLatticeVectors
  0.000  0.500  0.500      # primitive Si unit cell, in units of LatticeConstant
  0.500  0.000  0.500

%endblock RefoldingLatticeVectors

The UnfoldedBandLines block has the same format as BandLines, except for the first
line, which specifies the energy mesh for the density of states in q space (qDOS).
Also, it allows several q paths to be specified consecutively, each beginning with a 
single point. This allows a q-line not begin at the end of previous one, e.g.
%block UnfoldedBandLines
  320  -20.0  60 eV        # numEnergyIntervals, Emin, Emax, Eunit
   1   3.0  3.0  3.0       # mustBeOne, first_qVector (in units of BandLinesScale)
 100   0.0  0.0  0.0       # line_numq, endLine_qVector
 120   6.0  0.0  0.0       # add as many path lines as required
   1   0.0  0.0  0.0       # new path (begins with a single point)
 100   4.0  4.0  0.0
%endblock UnfoldedBandLines

The unfolded and refolded bands calculated by unfold are written in files
SYSLABEL.unfoldedBands and SYSLABEL.refoldedBands (where SYSLABEL=si8 in 
previous example). The first one contains the fully-unfolded bands and 
the second one contains the refolded bands. Both have the same format:
----------
nq, ne, Emin, Emax               (in energy units given in UnfoldedBandLines)
  qVector(ixyz=1:3,iq=1), iLine  (q in Bohr^-1, line to which it belongs)
qDOS(ie=1,iq=1)
qDOS(2,1)
...
qDOS(ne,1)
  qVector(1:3,2)
qDOS(1,2)
...
qDOS(ne,2)
  ...
  qVector(1:3,nq)
qDOS(1,2)
...
qDOS(ne,nq)
----------
where nq=1+100+120=221 is the total number of q vectors in q-path and 
ne=numEnergyIntervals+1=321 is the number of energies, in previous example.

If several q paths are given in UnfoldedBandLines, the bands of each one
are written in different output files, with suffixes .path1, .path2, etc.
Also, for spin polarized systems, the two spin bands are written in two
separate files with suffixes .spinUp and .spinDn

If RefoldingLatticeVectors is not present in the fdf datafile, only the
fully-unfolded bands are calculated and written. If UnfoldedBandLines
is not present, RefoldingLatticeVectors has no effect: nothing is calculated
nor written by unfold.

The UnfoldedBandLines and RefoldingLatticeVectors blocks are compatible with, and
independent of, the BandLines block. The latter is read and processed by siesta,
while the first two are read and processed by unfold.

The simulation cell will usually be a supercell of the unit cell, but this is not
required by unfold. I.e. bands can be unfolded and then refolded to any Brillouin
zone, not necessarily commensurate with the simulation cell used by siesta.
Notice, however, that this requires a new diagonalization for each q+G vector,
what may be very expensive in terms of CPU time.

The refolded G vectors are those with G^2<RefoldingGcutoff. Therefore,
RefoldingGcutoff largely determines the accuracy (and CPU time) for refolding.
Its default value is 50 ry.

The CPU time used by unfold is proportional to the number of q vectors, but it
does not increase with the energy resolution of the qDOS mesh (the size of the
output files is proportional to the number of energies, though). Since the
parallelization over q vectors is almost perfect, execution wall-clock time
is inversely proportional to the number of MPI nodes, provided they are less
than the number of q points in UnfoldedBandLines.

Final note: in a supercell calculation, to not break artificially the translational crystal symmetry, we should use an integration mesh commensurate with the unit cell.
This can be ensured with the following procedure:
1) Perform a unit-cell siesta calculation with the desired input MeshCutoff.
2) In the output file, look for the MeshCutoff actually used (grep 'Mesh cutoff 
   (required, used)' output_file)
3) Perform the supercell calculation with an input MeshCutoff slightly lower 
   (say by 0.001 Ry). This will make siesta choose the same actual MeshCutoff and
   the same, commensurate, integration mesh as in the unit cell calculation.
4) In a slab calculation, construct the simulation cell by removing atoms from
   a bulk supercell, so that the simulation-cell lattice vectors make an exact
   supercell of the crystal unit cell.
