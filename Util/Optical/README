The programs contained in this directory calculate different
optical properties of a solid out of the file 

         Systemlabel.EPSIMG 

generated by SIESTA, that contains the imaginary part of the
dielectric function in the energy range specified in the
input file of SIESTA.

There are two small programs:

input.f 

and

optical.f


Both can be compile independently:

     f77 input.f -o input
     
     f77  optical.f -o optical


The first program creates the input file for optical, containing the 
imaginary part of the dielectric function, from the file

          Systemlabel.EPSIMG

To do so, you just need to type:

       input < Systemlabel.EPSIMG

The program will create the file 'e2.dat' if there is not spin polarization,
or the files 'e2.dat.spin1' and 'e2.dat.spin2' for the spin polarized case.

If the F-sum rule is not fulfilled by an amount larger than certain 
percentage specified in the program via the parameter THRESHOLD, 
the imaginary part of the dielectric function will be appended
by a tail of the form:
                   
                       C/w**p

where C and p are determine to ensure continuity and to enforce the F-sum rule.
This should increase the quality of the quantities determined via the
Kramers-Kroning relations, however it is not very sophisticated and in certain
cases it can create pathological problems. Anyway, it can be easily 
desactivated by setting THRESHOLD to zero.


The program optical.f reads a file called 'e2.dat' containing the imaginary part
of the dieletric function, and creates a file 'e1.out' that contains the 
real part of the  dieletric function, 'e2.out' the imaginary part calculated
back out of the data in 'e1.out', this serves as a cross check of the quality 
of the Kramers-Kroning transformation. 
Also creates the files:

'refrac_index.out'   containing the refraction index
'absorp_index.out'  containing the extintion coefficient
'absorp_coef.out'    containing the absorption coefficient in cm**-1
'reflectance.out'     containing the reflectance
'conductivity.out'     containing the optical conductivity in (ohm*m)**-1
