- AnalyzeSort
  this directory contains a python script that can sort an FDF
  structure according to the output of TranSIESTA if one uses
  the flag:
    TS.Analyze T
  Refer to the manual for additional information

- tselecs.sh
  This small scripts eases the creation of several electrodes
  input. It can also be used to initialize a script for TranSIESTA.
  Call with:
    tselecs.sh -2
  to generate a default input FDF for TranSIESTA which defaults
  to the old versions implementation.

- TBtrans
  this directory contains the TBtrans utility which is used for 
  calculating the transmission and other quatities from the 
  TSHS files output from TranSIESTA.

- ts2ts
  A small utility which takes an old input file for TranSIESTA
  and converts it into the new input format.
  First call make in the folder and then you can utilise it as:
    ts2ts <fdf-file> 
  and it will print out a converted fdf-input file.
  It is made for piping directly into another file.

  REMARK: It will only read in TranSIESTA options and thus
          also only print TranSIESTA options. 
	  It will not copy any other FDF-flags.
