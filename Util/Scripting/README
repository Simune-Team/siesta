The scripts

h2o.py
bond.py
client.py
ase.py
ase_relax.py
ase_newton.py
ase_verlet.py

perform Siesta calculations (calling the program directly or
using it as a server). Their interface to Siesta is implemented
in modules in the Siesta directory.

The script simplex_optim.py is a crude driver for a basis set
optimization.

Please note that the location of the Siesta executable must
be specified in the scripts at this point.

Directory scripts/ contains some general-purpose utilities.

The Siesta package can be installed in the appropriate Python
directory using the setup.py file.
