How to implement multiple-cell views?

-- Insert simple code in plstm. But how to specify this in the input?
   (command-line arguments -- will break compatibility with AiiDA)
   (maybe only -x NX -y NY allowed as arguments).

-- Create a "multiplier" for grid files in m_gridfunc. But this does not
   make much sense.

-- Intermediate: Multiply the "2D data" after the main computation (just generate
   to an array, instead of writing directly to stdout).
