This directory documents support for calling siesta as a subroutine from a 
user's program. There are two versions that use different communication modes:
- The 'pipes' version uses Unix/Linux pipes for communications between the 
  user's program and siesta, which are compiled independently. The user's
  program must be compiled with file fsiesta_pipes.f90, and call routines
  in this module to send coordinates to siesta and receive forces from it.
- The 'MPI' version requires the user's program to be compiled together
  with siesta, which becomes a true subroutine. Despite its name, this
  version works also in serial mode, not requiring MPI in this case.
Both versions allow multiple instances of siesta to run and communicate
simultaneously with the master program, without mixing their data nor
communicating among them. However, to do this, the MPI version requires to
run in parallel using MPI. Both versions use the same calling interfaces,
so that the same user's code can be used with any of them (although the
MPI version has some extra functionalities).

To use the package, you must:
1) Write a normal fdf data file for the siesta program (see the siesta
   manual for instructions) with the following characteristics:
 - The SystemLabel contained in it MUST be identical to the file prefix.
   I.e. if the file is h2o.fdf, the SystemLabel must be h2o
 - There must be a 'MD.TypeOfRun forces' statement in it
 - The number of atoms, the atomic species, and the order of them (in the
   coordinates specification) must be consistent with the arguments in the
   calls to the subroutine siesta_forces (see below).
 - The values of the atomic coordinates and cell vectors are arbitrary 
   (e.g. they may be zero), since they will be reset by your first call
   to siesta_forces.
 - The atomic numbers, siesta basis set, and all the remaining siesta 
   parameters, other than the atomic coordinates and cell vectors will be 
   those specified in the fdf data file. If not present, they will be set by
   siesta according to the defaults values explained in the siesta manual.
2) Write a main program or subroutine(s) of your own that contains:
 - A 'use fsiesta' statement in each routine with any of the following
   calls.
 - A single call, in the whole program, to each of: siesta_launch, 
   siesta_units, and siesta_quit.
 - Calls to siesta_forces (after those to siesta_launch and siesta_units
   and before the call to siesta_quit) to get the atomic forces at each
   required coordinates.
 - Calls to siesta_get to retrieve some (restricted) magnitudes used or
   calculated by siesta, other than those returned by siesta_forces.
 - In all the previous calls, the 'label' argument must be the same as
   the prefix of the siesta fdf data file (i.e. 'h2o' for h2o.fdf).
 - Compile your program, with a copy, in your compilation directory, of:
   - siesta/Src/fsiesta_pipes.f90 (pipes version). See siesta/Src/Makefile
     for the appropriate compilation flags and flush routine.
   - siesta/Obj/libSiestaForces.a and siesta/Obj/*.mod (MPI version)
 - Run your program.
3) Your program may call more than one siesta process, for example to
   combine the calculations of two different systems, or of the same
   system with different precision parameters (see FmixMD for an example).
   In this case you must:
 - Write an fdf file for each siesta process (obviously with different
   names and consistent SystemLabel-s)
 - Make as many calls to siesta_launch, etc, as siesta processes you
   want to use, with consistent label arguments. In the MPI version, the
   different siesta processes must be called from different (groups of)
   MPI processes.
4) Depending on your compiler and operating system, it may occur that
   the communication pipes still exist after yor program terminates
   (normally or abnormally). In that case, simply remove them, as if
   they were normal files (pipes version only).
5) Make sure that you have a working "flush" subroutine in your system,
   and that it is compiled-in (in file pxf.F90 in the main source directory)
   through the appropriate preprocessor symbols. Otherwise the process 
   might hang. The compilation of fsiesta_pipes.f90 in the main directory 
   should automate this, but you should check (pipes version only).

General notice about compilers:
1) GCC have removed support for piped files since version 4.7.0. Thus if 
   using gfortran, you need to have 4.6.x. or older.

! Subroutines usage:
!
!   call siesta_launch( label, nnodes, mpi_comm )
!     character(len=*),intent(in) :: label    : Name of siesta process
!                                               (prefix of its .fdf file)
!     integer,optional,intent(in) :: nnodes   : Number of MPI nodes
!     integer,optional,intent(in) :: mpi_comm : Communicator (MPI version only)
!

!     character(len=*), intent(in) :: label      : Name of siesta process
!     integer,          intent(in) :: na         : Number of atoms

!     real(dp),optional,intent(out):: fa(3,na)   : Atomic forces
!     real(dp),optional,intent(out):: stress(3,3): Stress tensor
!
!   call siesta_get( label, property, value, units )  (MPI version only)
!     character(len=*), intent(in) :: label      : Name of siesta process
!     character(len=*), intent(in) :: property   : Name of required magnitude
!     real(dp),         intent(out):: value      : Value of the magnitude
!                                                (various dimensions overloaded)
!     character(len=*), intent(out):: units      : Name of physical units
!
!   call siesta_quit( label )
!     character(len=*),intent(in) :: label  : Name of one siesta process,
!                                             or 'all' to stop all procs.
! Behaviour:
! - If mpi_comm is present in a call to siesta_launch, nnodes is ignored
!   (MPI version).
! - If nnodes is not present among siesta_launch arguments, or nnodes<2, 
!   a serial siesta process will be launched. Otherwise, a parallel 
!   mpirun process will be launched (pipes version).
! - If siesta_units is not called, length='Ang', energy='eV' are
!   used by default. If it is called more than once, the units in the
!   last call become in effect.
! - The physical units set by siesta_units are used for all the siesta
!   processes launched
! - If siesta_forces is called without a previous call to siesta_launch
!   for that label:
!   - It assumes that the siesta process has been launched (and the 
!     communication pipes created) externally in the shell. In this case, 
!     siesta_forces only opens its end of the pipes and begins communication
!     through them (pipes version).
!   - The first call to siesta_forces generates a call to siesta_launch
!     without nnodes nor mpi_comm present (MPI version).
! - If argument cell is not present in the call to siesta_forces, or if
!   the cell has zero volume, it is assumed that the system is a molecule,
!   and a supercell is generated automatically by siesta so that the 
!   different images do not overlap. In this case the stress returned
!   has no physical meaning.
!   ** Note ** : Further calls with no cell information will reset the
!   unit cell to a *different* one (since it is computed from the coordinates,
!   and these would have changed. If you would like to maintain the same
!   cell, you need to pass it explicitly (maybe doing a preliminary run
!   to get the automatically generated cell, and copying it to the fdf file
!   or to the client code itself.
! - The stress is defined as dE/d(strain)/Volume, with a positive sign
!   when the system tends to contract (negative pressure)
! - The following events result in a stopping error message:
!   - siesta_launch is called twice with the same label
!   - siesta_quit is called without a prior call to siesta_launch or
!     siesta_forces for that label
!   - file label.fdf is not found
!   - NumberOfAtoms in label.fdf is different from na input in siesta_forces
!   - siesta_forces finds a communication error trough the pipes
!   - MPI has not been correctly initialized by the driver prog (MPI version)
!   - mpi_comm is not a valid MPI communicator
!   - two MPI processes in the same siesta process have a different label
!   - two different labels are used in any calls within the same MPI process
!   - An input argument of siesta_forces differs in two MPI processes within
!     the same siesta process
! - If siesta_quit is not called for a launched siesta process, that
!   process will stay listening indefinitedly to the pipe and will need
!   to be killed in the shell (pipes version).
! - siesta_units may be called either before or after siesta_launch

The data flow between the user's 'master' program and siesta is as follows:
  Using unix pipes (master program compiled with fsiesta_pipes.F90):
    master <--> fsiesta_pipes <--pipe--> iopipes <--> siesta_master <--> siesta
  Using MPI (master program compiled with libSiestaForces.a):
    master <--> fsiesta_mpi <--> siesta_master <--> siesta
