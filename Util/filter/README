Test framework for new filtering procedure.

Alberto Garcia, August 2008
Based on code by Jose Soler and Eduardo Anglada

For help, type

test_filter -h 

A collection of .dat files (taken from .ion files of several siesta runs) are provided.

core.dat is the core charge of the Pb test.
The ti-* and ba-* files come from the BaTiO3 test.

The resulting .log files can be plotted with gnuplot, for example.


Note that for the ti-4p-orb.dat file the "default" kc would be too high, and it is reset
to the maximum (heuristically) allowed.
