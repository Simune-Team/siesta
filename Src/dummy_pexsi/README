A simple set of dummy routines to emulate the calling sequence in
PEXSI. They are compatible with the interface specification in
m_pexsi_interface.f90 in the source directory.

Ideally, they should return something that would allow the program to
continue. As they stand now, there is an infinite loop of
inertia-count calls.

Note that the use of the FORTRAN() macro in this C source (mimicking
what Lin does in the original C++ source) implies that the interface
specification usind ISO_C_BINDING needs to specify an explicit name
with an extra underscore.

To use it, add "libdummy_pexsi.a" or "libdummy_raw_pexsi.a" to the
COMP_LIBS macro in your arch.make file.

The "raw" version contains only the new raw inertia-count interface,
which might not be available on all platforms for some time.
