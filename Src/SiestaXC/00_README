SiestaXC library

This directory contains, as a self-contained package the source code of the 
siestaXC library, used by the SIESTA program. It provides routines to calculate 
the exchange and correlation energy and potential in spherical (i.e. an atom) 
and periodic systems, using a variety of LDA and GGA functionals, as well as
the van der Waals DFT functional of Dion et al (PRL 92, 246401 (2004)), 
implemented as described by Roman-Perez and Soler (PRL 103, 096102 (2009))

See siestaXC.f90 for how to call the siestaXC library routines

To compile the library:

- Place the SiestaXC directory hanging from your main-program's directory.

- In your main-program's directory, write a file called arch.make, specifying 
  your compiler options, e.g.
#--------------------
FC=g95 -O3 -DGRID_DP
#
.F.o:
	$(FC) -c $<
.f.o:
	$(FC) -c $<
.F90.o:
	$(FC) -c $<
.f90.o:
	$(FC) -c $<
#--------------------

- Type "make" in the SiestaXC subdirectory. This will create the library and
  copy files libSiestaXC.a and siestaxc.mod to your main-program's directory.

- Compile the rest of the program.

Some f90 compilers (notably Intel's) require all the .mod files (and not only
siestaxc.mod) to be present when compiling your main program. In this case,
substitute the following lines in makefile:

module:  libSiestaXC.a
	cp siestaxc.mod *.a ..

by

module:  libSiestaXC.a
	cp *.mod *.a ..

Notice that this may lead to some name conflicts with your main program.
