Test framework for new filtering procedure.

Alberto Garcia, August 2008

For help, type

test_filter -h 

A collection of .dat files (taken from .ion files of several siesta runs) are provided.

core.dat is the core charge of the Pb test.
The ti-* and ba-* files come from the BaTiO3 test.

Note that the filtering does not work well in the ti-4p-orb.dat file.  It has a node, but
so does ba-6s-orb.dat.  The latter has L=0, but it can also be made to work with L=1, as a
"make run_tests" would show.

The resulting .log files can be plotted with gnuplot, for example.
