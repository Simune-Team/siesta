A single makefile can be used to build siesta for different
architectures and compilers, provided the following steps are taken:

* Look for a .make file in this directory that might be appropriate for
  your particular configuration. If there is none, write your own using
  the existing files as guides.

* Define in your environment a variable SIESTA_SYS, giving it as value the
  basename of the appropriate .make file. For example, assuming you
  have a Dec Alpha with DXML libraries:

	SIESTA_SYS=osfdxml ; export SIESTA_SYS  (sh, ksh, bash, etc)
	setenv SIESTA_SYS osfdxml         (csh and derivatives)


One of the macros set in the .make files refers to machine-dependent
routines, which are kept in different .f files in the Src directory,
according to the architecture and compiler/library capabilities.
