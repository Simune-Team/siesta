The single top-level Makefile can be used to build SIESTA for different
architectures and compilers, provided the following steps are taken:

* Look for a .make file in this directory that might be appropriate for
  your particular configuration. If there is none, write your own using
  the existing files as guides.

* Copy or link the file to the Src directory, renaming it as "arch.make".

The macro SYS in the .make files refers to files holding
machine-dependent routines, which are kept in the Src directory,
according to the architecture and compiler/library capabilities.

NetCDF hooks:

If you have netcdf V3.5 installed, you can set the macros NETCDF_XXX
(as in some of the example files) to use it.
