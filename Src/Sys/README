A single makefile can be used to build siesta for different
architectures and compilers, provided the following steps are taken:

* Look for a .make file in this directory that might be appropriate for
  your particular configuration. If there is none, write your own using
  the existing files as guides.

* Copy or link the file to the Src directory, renaming it as "arch.make".

One of the macros set in the .make files refers to machine-dependent
routines, which are kept in different .f files in the Src directory,
according to the architecture and compiler/library capabilities.

NetCDF hooks:

If you have netcdf V3.5 installed, you can set the macros NETCDF_XXX
(as in some of the example files) to use it.
