-- Add function to get the grid for a particular function...
-- Clarify which elements can have their own sub-grids (currently only
pseudopotential-operator and radfunc)
-- Try to hide the implementation
-- Try to make it easier to interoperate with C
-- Write a dumper to PSML from ps_t (useful once we have more converters)
-- Add schema (see doc directory)
