Go to src and make sure that the macros in fortran.mk are
appropriate. You can either edit that file and then simply type

       make

or provide an *absolute* path to a new macro file of your choice to
'make' at invokation time. For example:

       make PSML_MK=`pwd`/mymacros.mk
or
       make PSML_MK=/path/to/mymacros.mk

This would take care of everything, including the compilation of the
xmlf90-sax helper library, which is a subset of the xmlf90 package.
