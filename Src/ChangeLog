	* Implemented a simple mechanism to reflect the version number in
	the executable. A version string in 'version.h' should be updated
	after every self-consistent commit, and a "patch level" number
	incremented by one. Calls to a routine 'prversion' will cause the
	version string to be printed. 

	After every change to the code, this file "ChangeLog" should be
	updated, to describe the nature of the change, the files affected,
	and the PL number to which the code is brought by the change.

	Files affected: prversion.f (new), version.h (new), siesta.f (mod).
			Makefile (mod).
	This change brings siesta to Version 0.8.5 -- PL 23.
