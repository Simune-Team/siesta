Use the code in this directory if you do not have compiled (presumably
optimized) blas and lapack libraries in your system.

Define COMP_LIBS = linalg.a

	in your XXXXX.make file

You might have the basic Lapack stuff but not the "divide and conquer" routines
from version 3.0 of Lapack. In that case, define
	
	COMP_LIBS= dc_lapack.a

	in your XXXXX.make file.
