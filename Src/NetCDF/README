The routines in this directory implement a fortran90 interface
to the NetCDF library. Its use is optional in SIESTA.

NOTE

Some (old) versions of Compaq compilers cannot deal with the code in
netcdf_text_variables.f90. So far the routines there are not needed by
siesta, so the 'include' statement in netcdf.f90 has been commented
out for now, and mentions to 'text' routines removed from the
interface definitions in netcdf_overloads.f90.

If those routines are ever needed, the *.orig files should be used
instead (and a workaround found for the buggy compilers).
