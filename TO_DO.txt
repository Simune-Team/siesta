Things to do in this branch before merging:

* Add code to show the contents of the ylmk and matel tables.
* Add a "name" field to the tables.
* Adhere to the coding guidelines in Docs/developer/...
* Add code to (re)-initialize the tables.
* Move the initialization of the PAO, Vna, and KB tables to
  siesta_init.
* Maybe move the initialization of LDAU-related tables to the ldau
  module.
* Defer the initialization of the Polarization and Optical tables
  until the analysis stage.
* Defer the initialization of the Wannier tables
* (In connection to the above): make sure that possible Lua-driven cases are
  treated correctly.
* Maybe eliminate the vna special case in the evaluation routine in
  matel_registry (factor of Y_00=1/sqrt(4*pi)).
* Maybe use "object-oriented" techniques in matel_registry to handle
  radfuncs and trial_orbitals.
* Add FORD documentation for the new suite of modules.
* Add "unit tests"
