The only basic change from the 'onsite' implementation is in the
construction of the SO hamiltonian, which involves the full set of lj
KB projectors. These are constructed by new code in 'atom', and
processed in the new routine 'nlefsm_SO_off', which has roughly the
same structure as 'nlefsm', but constructs at the same time the 'ion'
and 'SO' pieces from the relativistic projectors.

This routine calls 'calc_Vj_offsiteSO', where VSO and Vion and the
corresponding forces are computed using the Clebschâ€“Gordan
coefficients needed to change from the basis |l,m,sigma> to |j,mj>.

The conventions for structure and signs in H and the DM are the same
as in the existing 'onsite' implementation, so there are no changes in
the diagonalization routines, or in the analysis routines and tools.

Eventually, the 'offsite' qualifier might be removed, as this is a
full spin-orbit implementation.
