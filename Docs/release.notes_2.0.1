*  Fix file prefix identification in m_denchar_init

    m_denchar_init was not aware of the new 'files' module which
    stores the filename prefix. Thus the call to iodm failed to
    find the density-matrix file.

*   Siesta-server steps treated correctly for CML output

    When Siesta is used as a server (MD.TypeOfRun forces), each
    "step" is labelled as "FS" ("force server") and the right
    module element is opened in the CML output.
    
    (Note that in principle there is no "Finalization" module in this
    mode of operation.)

*   Add revPBE to xc_check in atom.f -- tidy 

    The recently added revPBE functional was not included in the check
    in atom.f. The code has been re-organized to reduce clutter.

*   Fix reading of nspin variable in pdosxml

    The data for nspin is contained in pcdata, and its reading as a single
    fortran item is tricky in some platforms. The only safe way to process 
    it is to use the logic involved in the "build_data_array" suite.

*   Use fixed dc_lapack.f together with any system libraries

    Javier Junquera got a new version of DLAED6 (part of LAPACK's
    divide-and-conquer package) from Ren-Cang Li <rcli@cs.uky.edu>. It
    partially solves some strange numerical instability problems. Codes 
    produced by most compiler flag combinations now work (exceptions include
     "-xP -mp1" for the Intel compiler).
    
    As the "Divide and Conquer" code in most system libraries is
    buggy, provisions have been made in configure to always compile
    dc_lapack.f. In some cases this feature needs a supporting loader
    flag (such as -Wl,-z muldefs for the GNU loader) to allow multiple
    definition of symbols. An example of configure driver for the Intel
    Fortran compiler is in Src/Confs/intel9mkl8-safe.conf.
    
    Also, the unused routines zheevd and dsyevd have been removed from
    dc_lapack.f

*   Remove external declaration of 'timer' in spher_harm and radfft.

    Timer is declared external but not used in spher_harm and radfft.
    A problem appears only when compiling denchar from clean source.
