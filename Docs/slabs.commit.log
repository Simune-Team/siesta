Code to treat slabs with net dipole and charged slabs (P. Ordejon)

If the FDF option 'SlabDipoleCorrection' is set to "true", Siesta
calculates the electric field required to compensate the dipole of the
system. The potential added to the grid corresponds to that of a
dipole layer at the middle of the vacuum layer. For slabs, this
exactly compensates the electric field at the vacuum, created by the
dipole moment of the system, thus allowing to deal with asymmetric
slabs (including systems with an adsorbate on one surface) and compute
properties such as the work funcion of each of the surfaces.

The FDF option SimulateDoping, if "true", instructs the program to add
a background charge density to simulate doping.  The new "doping"
routine calculates the net charge of the system, and adds a
compensating background charge that makes the system neutral. This
background charge is constant at points of the mesh near the atoms,
and zero at points far from the atoms.  This simulates situations like
doped slabs, where the extra electrons (holes) are compensated by
oposite charges at the material (the ionized dopant impurities), but
not at the vacuum.  This serves to simulate properly doped systems in
which there are large portions of vacuum, such as doped slabs.
