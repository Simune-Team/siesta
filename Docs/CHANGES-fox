Update FoX to version 4.1.0
  
  Version 4.1.0 of FoX, used to produce our XML output was released 
  on 2010-02-09. This patch updates the version shipped with Siesta 
  to this version. 

  Changes that affect Siesta are that the build process for FoX can
  now take advantage of possible parallelization (make -j), we can 
  ask FoX to generate an abort signal if it kills the process and 
  the inclusion of work arounds for compiler bugs in recent versions 
  of the pgi compiler. Some of these changes existed in an (unrelased)
  version of FoX shipped with Siesta since revision 320.
