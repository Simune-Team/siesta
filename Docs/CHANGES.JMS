Increased parameter nr in vdwxc, to avoid an out-of-bounds condition

An out of bounds condition was occurring in vdwxc when called by atom
pseudopotential generation program. With ifort, this lead to program
crash or to an overflow of the system memory. To solve this, parameter 
nr been increased from 1024 to 2048, and a check has been added.
