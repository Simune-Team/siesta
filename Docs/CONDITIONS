   POLICY FOR THE USE, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION OF SIESTA 0.11
   =================================================================

MOTIVATION:

The SIESTA program has been devised for its general use in research
within the academic community. It is not being developed with the idea
of its remaining for the particular use of a group or limited set of
groups.  However, two considerations are relevant at this point: (1)
The program is still at a relatively early stage of development, and
(2) a team has been and is dedicating an important effort for the
making, maintaining, and developing of SIESTA.  Therefore, some
conditions have been defined for the use, distribution, and
modification of SIESTA, which the authors consider fair and within the
common fair practices in the academic community.  We think that
considering possible conflicts early may avoid misunderstandings and
problems later. We are open to suggestions concerning this policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL POLICY:

SIESTA IS NOT TO BE USED, DISTRIBUTED, NOR MODIFIED WITHOUT THE
PREVIOUS CONSENT OF THE AUTHORS (see the authors below). 

This clearly implies that no person should have access to
the code without the previous knowledge and consent of the authors.
The authors will keep a record of every person having access to the
code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

USE:

Because of the two points mentioned in the motivation, the use of 
SIESTA by any group will be IN COLLABORATION (co-authoring) WITH 
AT LEAST ONE of the authors or developers of the code (see names below), 
until the author(s)/developer(s) consider it approriate to stop the 
collaboration. This condition applies to new SIESTA 1.1 users, and 
does not invalidate the conditions previously agreed in collaborations
that started with earlier versions.

In addition, the author of any new substantial development of 
the code will receive credit by co-authoring the first publication
using that development. This circumstance will be clarified at
the beginning of any new project.

The user may have SIESTA installed in whatever computer 
facilities he/she may consider appropriate for the particular 
project, as long as it does not imply any relation of SIESTA 
with the institution to which the user is adscribed.
SIESTA is given to the user personally, for an open scientific 
collaboration, not to her/his institution. This point has to be
observed with special care in private or military institutions.
The code will be ONLY accesible to the persons involved in the
collaboration, as agreed with the SIESTA developer, and whose names 
have been communicated to the authors.

The final goal is to have a version valid for distribution 
that will not require support. The collaboration with authors 
or developers will not be needed at that stage (the conditions 
for distribution of the code at that point are yet to be defined).
 
In any case, proper credit to SIESTA by appropriate citation
should be observed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEVELOPMENT AND CREDITS:

Our main considerations are:

1) Utility to the research community: we think that this
is best served by a well maintained program, assuring
its continuity and standard interfaces and avoiding
its branching. At the same time, we think that this
should be compatible with allowing others to contribute
with their own ideas and improvements.

2) Proper credit and benefits to all contributors.

3) We do not plan to comercialize SIESTA, and we expect 
to make it nearly freely available in the near future, 
at least to the academic community. However, we are aware 
that, if its usage becomes very widespread, it may
be difficult for us to deal with its maintainance, and
that the best option in the long future may be to delegate 
that work. Therefore, although not planned nor desired, 
we need to consider that possibility now.

From the above considerations:

1) The authors of SIESTA are:

      Emilio Artacho,        University of Cambridge
      Pablo Ordejon,         ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona
      Daniel Sanchez-Portal, Universidad del Pais Vasco, San Sebastian
      Jose M. Soler,         Autonomous Univ. of Madrid

Although we acknowledge that a limited number of auxiliary subroutines
were written by (or are based on previous subroutines written by)
other authors we consider that the implementation of all the basic
algorithms of the SIESTA program are ours.

   The developers of SIESTA are the authors and:

      Julian Gale,        Imperial College, London
      Alberto Garcia,     Universidad del Pais Vasco, Bilbao

2) As authors of the initial version of SIESTA, we reserve
to ourselves all the rights to resolve any conflicts in its 
development and distribution policies. Any others receiving
SIESTA for use or development are implicitly accepting this.

3) As far as possible, further developments of SIESTA
should be as modular as possible (interacting by files or
well-defined interface calls), allowing its independent
maintainance by their respective authors and, eventually,
its isolation for purposes of distribution. However, if
any developments need to be intertwined with the rest
of the program, their authors must delegate their
distribution rights to us, and they must rennounce to
distribute any alternative or modified version of SIESTA,
or of another program using parts of SIESTA, without our 
previous written permission. This resignation does not
affect any rights to receive proper credit (and eventually
other possible benefits) for their developments.

4) From a technical point of view, unless they provide 
dramatic improvements in efficiency or functionality,
we intend to be rather restrictive with developments whose 
lack of modularity may compromise the efficiency of the 
rest of the program, or difficult its maintainance or 
other future developments. Therefore, we decidedly
encourage to discuss previously with us any projected
developments.
