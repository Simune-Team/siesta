Fixes and new functionality in Pulay mixing

* The "kick" functionality intended to "shake" periodically the Pulay
mixing procedure was incorrectly implemented. This has now been fixed,
with the added feature that the Pulay history is completely reset
after a kick.

* Additionally, support has been added to specify whether the first
density-matrix residual of the SCF cycle and the first residual after
a kick are included in the Pulay history. It can be argued that in
these cases the "output" DM might be significantly different from the
"input" DM. To preserve backwards compatibility, these residuals are
kept in the Pulay history unless the fdf variable

      DM.Pulay.Avoid.First.After.Kick

is set to "true" in the input file.

* The above changes have forced a temporary disabling of the "Pulay on
  file" feature, which will be re-implemented in a form that works
  well in parallel.

* Updated the manual.
