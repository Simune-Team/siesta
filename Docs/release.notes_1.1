Release Notes for SIESTA-1.1, September 21, 2001


A list of the major new features and fixes added to the program since
the last main release, SIESTA-0.11 follows. See the Manual for 
documentation of the new features. A complete list of changes can also
be found in the Docs/CHANGES file.

USER-INTERFACE CHANGES

* SIESTA is now written in Fortran90. By using the dynamic memory
allocation features of the language, we have eliminated the need to
recompile the program for each particular project. Only a very small
number of parameters, which will seldom need to be changed, are still
hardwired. (See file Src/atmparams.f)

* SIESTA can now read ASCII (.psf extension) pseudopotential
files, in addition to the  binary ones (with the .vps
extension). Please note that files with the extension .psatom.data are
no longer accepted.

* Orbital and projector information can be saved to and read from files.

* ...

MAJOR NEW FEATURES

* Soft-confinement potentials can be used to generate smoother basis
sets.

REPORTING BUGS

This long-awaited version of SIESTA is a significant rewrite, and
incorporates a number of new features. We believe that it represents
an important step forward in functionality and ease of use. On the
other hand, due to the large number of changes and the wide variety of
options, modes of operation, and supported environments, it is very
likely that a number of quirks and bugs have escaped our detection.

That is why we request your cooperation. You should test the new
version by using it to re-run some of the calculations you have done
in the past and comparing the results, and by exercising any new
features you might want to start using.

Any problems should be reported back to us, using the "send-bug"
script located in the top directory or (better) the Web interface at
http://lcdx00.wm.lc.ehu.es/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl (accessible also from
the main SIESTA home page at http://www.uam.es/siesta). Please
tell us also about any problems regarding:

* Installation
* Documentation
* Memory use
* Speed
* Auxiliary programs

We encourage you to follow the bug reporting guidelines in the SIESTA
manual.
