Title: SIESTA-1.1f1 (bugfix 1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes since 1.1 release:

Summary: (See bug page on http://www.uam.es/siesta for more details)

* The "electrostatic correction" tables were not updated correctly.
  (basis_io.F)
* The extension of the NetCDF file was wrong.
  (basis_specs.f)
* The default mass assigned to "floating atoms" (which provide
  just their orbitals) was too big, and it led to overflows.
* (Parallel version) If the number of processors was greater than 1, 
  then the values in qspin() were wrong because the array was not 
  globally reduced. Hence the total spin difference was incorrectly printed.
  (siesta.F)
* In module atom.f, messages relating to the size of seldom-changed
  parameters pointed the user to file "atom.h". The correct reference
  is to file "atmparams.f".
  (atom.f)
* In routine pdos.f, the output of data pertaining to the PDOS in the
  spin-polarized case mistakenly included an energy field.
  (pdos.f)
* In routine vlocal_sub in file old_atmfuncs.f, the declaration of the
  dummy argument v was incorrect.
  (old_atmfuncs.f)
* Wrong edit descriptor in atom.f
  (atom.f)
* If the longest orbital of a given species was unoccupied in the
  free atom, then some points were wrongly skipped while calculating the
  integrals. This could lead to loss of accuracy.
  (dfscf.f, vmat.f, rhoofd.f)
