REPORTING BUGS 

Your assistance is essential to help improve the program. If you find
any problem, please report it back to us by email to
siesta@uam.es. Please keep in mind the following guidelines:

-- To be useful, bug reports should be as detailed as possible, yet
   concise and to the point.

-- Describe the exact steps you followed to see the problem. You might
   want to include a copy of the fdf file you used in the calculation,
   details about the pseudopotentials, etc, or provide a means for us
   to download the information. If in doubt, do not send large files.
   State the problem in the most concise form possible and we will
   request more info from you.

-- Be specific. Describe what happened and how it differs from what
   should have happened.

-- If you have any idea about how to fix the problem, by all means tell
   us!

-- Please make sure that your bug report includes: 

  - Your name and email address. This is essential for a proper
    followup of the problem.
  
  - A brief one-line synopsis of the problem.  

  - The Siesta version in which the problem was found. We can't assume
    that you have the very latest version, and a problem that exists
    in one version may not exist in another. Use the version number
    printed at the top of any output file (also found in file
    version.info in the top directory).

  - The platform on which the problem was found, and the operating
    system and compiler version. State whether the problem appears in
    a serial and/or parallel run. Including your arch.make is also a
    good idea.

-- Please limit your communication to one bug report per form or
   message.
