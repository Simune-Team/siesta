@article{Papior2017,
abstract = {We present novel methods implemented within the non-equilibrium Green function code (NEGF) transiesta based on density functional theory (DFT). Our flexible, next-generation DFT-NEGF code handles devices with one or multiple electrodes ({\$}N{\_}e\backslashge1{\$}) with individual chemical potentials and electronic temperatures. We describe its novel methods for electrostatic gating, contour opti- mizations, and assertion of charge conservation, as well as the newly implemented algorithms for optimized and scalable matrix inversion, performance-critical pivoting, and hybrid parallellization. Additionally, a generic NEGF post-processing code (tbtrans/phtrans) for electron and phonon transport is presented with several novelties such as Hamiltonian interpolations, {\$}N{\_}e\backslashge1{\$} electrode capability, bond-currents, generalized interface for user-de?ned tight-binding transport, transmission projection using eigenstates of a projected Hamiltonian, and fast inversion algorithms for large-scale simulations easily exceeding {\$}10{\^{}}6{\$} atoms on workstation computers. The new features of both codes are demonstrated and bench-marked for relevant test systems.},
