Incorporation of BSC code: mesh optimization; parallel fdf library

* The ongoing collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputer Center
(through the department of Computer Applications in Science and
Engineering) has resulted in two new main enhancements:

- New code to improve the load-balance among processors in the
operations carried out in the real-space mesh (involved in the
computation of charge density, exchange-correlation potential, and
matrix elements of the hamiltonian, among others).

Since the different operations have different work-load patterns, it
has been necessary to define and handle three separate data
distributions, with appropriately optimized communication patterns.
Most of the new code is contained in new specialized modules, and
there are calls for data distribution handling in higher-level
modules, notably dhscf.

An overview of the rationale and implementation of the new functionality
can be found in

We are working on a set of developer-oriented notes to facilitate
future enhancements.

- A new fdf library which avoids the 'master node bottleneck': each
MPI processor now holds a copy of the relevant information, and can
satisfy fdf queries without the need for interprocess communication or
file access.

The most noticeable change is in the processing of fdf blocks. The previous
version of the library provided a Fortran unit number from which the
user code could read the block contents. Now the user is given an
abstract handle with which to perform explicitly the operations of reading
lines, parse, and extract useful information. This paradigm was already
present as a wrapper in previous versions of Siesta, but it is now mandatory.

The two new developments, while formally independent, have been merged
at the same time due to historical and logistical reasons. Even though
the mesh enhancements affect directly only a relatively small number
of files, many others have been modified: some by changes in memory
allocation syntax and indentation, and some to clarify code patterns
or interfaces (see below). The new treatment of fdf blocks and the
removal of the explicit broadcast step in some existing fdf calls has
meant changes to many other files. In all, this patch affects several
dozen files in the Siesta distribution.

* Other significant changes

- The interface to the spherical-harmonics module in matel has been
changed to avoid the creation of temporary arrays at run time. Also,
some internal arrays in the spherical-harmonics module are now
pre-allocated to avoid overhead.

- Throughout the code most 'allocatable' arrays have been turned into
pointers, to be able to exploit the functionality in the alloc module
to resize them concisely. It can be argued that we have gone too far
in some cases.

We have invested a lot of effort in this work, but it is very likely
that some issues have escaped us. A list of those known at this
time can be found in the file Docs/KNOWN.ISSUES.BSC-patch
