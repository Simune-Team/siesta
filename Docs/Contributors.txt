*******************************************************************

The SIESTA project was initiated by Pablo Ordejon (then at the Univ. de
Oviedo), and Jose M. Soler and Emilio Artacho (Univ. Autonoma de Madrid,
UAM).  The development team was then joined by Alberto Garcia (then at
Univ. del Pais Vasco, Bilbao), Daniel Sanchez-Portal (UAM), and
Javier Junquera (Univ. de Oviedo and later UAM), and sometime later by
Julian Gale (then at Imperial College, London). In 2007 Jose M. Cela
(Barcelona Supercomputing Center, BSC) became a core developer.

The TranSiesta module within SIESTA was originally developed by
Pablo Ordejon and Jose L. Mozos (then at ICMAB-CSIC), and Mads Brandbyge,
Kurt Stokbro, and Jeremy Taylor (Technical Univ. of Denmark).

O.F. Sankey, D.J. Niklewski and D.A. Drabold made the FIREBALL code
available to P. Ordejon.  Although we no longer use the routines in
that code, it was essential in the initial development of SIESTA,
which still uses many of the algorithms developed by them.
