\section{EGGBOX EFFECT}

Description.

A rather accurate diagnosis of the eggbox effect to be expected from a
given pseudopotential/basis-set combination can be carried out using
the Util/Scripting/eggbox\_checker.py script.

Ways to lessen it, including filtering. ** Does anybody have a good
``filtering success story"??
