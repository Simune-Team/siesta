\section{SCRIPTING UTILITIES}

We provide an experimental python scripting framework built on top of the
'Atomic Simulation Environment' (see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase2)
NOTE: You need "ASE version 2", not the new version 3.

There are objects implementing the "Siesta as server" feature, and
also hooks for file-oriented-communication usage.

Some example scripts can be found in Util/Scripting. Among them:

\begin{itemize}
      \item geometry optimization using ASE's methods
      \item eggbox checker
\end{itemize}

Users can create their own scripts to customize the "outer geometry loop"
in Siesta, or to perform various repetitive calculations in compact form.

Note that the interfaces in this framework are still evolving and are 
subject to change. 

Suggestions for improvements can be sent to Alberto Garcia (albertog@icmab.es)
