There are some new options in Siesta for Basis Set generation. This is an overview
of the main knobs, with some guidelines for usage.

(Very incomplete. Examples needed)

Guidelines for Basis-set generation.

1. Choose a "size" of the basis set.

SZ, DZ, SZP, DZP (default), TZP, ....

2. Range of the orbitals. 

Use the global PAO.EnergyShift option, or provide a PAO.Basis block.
Specify in principle only the range of the 1st zeta orbital.

2.a. Construction of multiple-zeta orbitals.

A global PAO.SplitNorm parameter can be used, or per-shell split-norms given.

2.b  Construction of polarization orbitals.

The default "electric-field" option is STILL BUGGY (FIX THIS**), so it might
be better to use a PAO.Basis block and specify them directly.

3. Soft-Confinement

Soft-confinement options (inner radius, prefactor) have been traditionally used
to optimize the basis set, even though formally they are just a technical necessity
to soften the decay of the orbitals at rc. To achieve this, it is just enough to
use a global (or maybe per-shell) set of values, with the PAO.Softdefaults option.
