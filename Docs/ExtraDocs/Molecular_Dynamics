See the manual for general options.

The XV and MD files contain the current velocities at each time step,
and the positions *predicted* for next step. This was historically
needed to facilitateseamless restarts of MD runs, but even then
restarting did not work well in some cases. To fix this, a new set of
auxiliary files (VERLET\_RESTART and others) were introduced, but the
fix is not complete in all cases nor satisfactory from a fundamental
point of view, so the MD subsystem in Siesta will have to be
redesigned. 

In the meantime, users are reminded that the scripting hooks being
steadily introduced (see Util/Scripting) might be used to create
custom-made MD scripts.
