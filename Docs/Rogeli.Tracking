End of implementation of distributed indexp

Rogeli has fixed the initialization of ne via extMeshBox and removed
some mpi barriers in dhscf.

(Snapshot taken at 1pm Feb. 11. Work finished late in Feb 5, according
to Rogeli).

(Some extra Jacobi-Davidson updates as of Feb 11 not incorporated)

Implementation of distributed indexp (work in progress)

Rogeli has taken the ideas of Jose Soler regarding the distributed
indexp and implemented a 'per-distribution, per-processor' extended mesh
and associated index arrays.

Some issues of re-initialization upon atomic movements are still pending.

Some other cosmetic changes, mostly regarding debugging.
(Except in dhscf, where a few uses of "reord" have changed)

(Snapshot taken in the afternoon of Feb. 5)
